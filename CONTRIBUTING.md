Contributing
============
Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to spark-inequality-impact.
Your help is essential for keeping it great.

Contribution Agreement
======================

As a contributor, you represent that the code you submit is your
original work or that of your employer (in which case you represent
you have the right to bind your employer).  By submitting code, you
(and, if applicable, your employer) are licensing the submitted code

Before Opening a New Issue
==========================
Check [README.md](./README.md), [setup.md](./setup.md), and [spark-inequality-impact.pdf](./spark-inequality-impact/src/main/tex/spark-inequality-impact.pdf) to see if the
behavior you observed might be expected and if configuration options
are available to provide you with the desired behavior.

Perform a cursory search to see if there's an existing issue covering your
feedback. If there is one and the issue is still open, add a reaction on the
issue to express interest in the issue being resolved. That will help the team
gauge interest without the noise of comments which trigger notifications to all
watchers. Comments should be used only if you have new and useful information
to share.

Consider if you're giving feedback which involves sharing sensitive information
(e.g. the name of your private repository). If you're concerned about sharing
such information in a public repository, please reach out via GitHub Support
instead to provide that feedback.

When Opening an Issue for a Feature Request Please Do the Following
-------------------------------------------------------------------
* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Include as many details as possible in the body. Explain your use-case, the problems you're hitting and the solutions you'd like to see to address those problems.
* When opening an issue for a bug report, explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it.
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.


Tips for Getting Your Pull Request Accepted
===========================================

1. Make sure all new features are tested and the tests pass.
2. Bug fixes must include a test case demonstrating the error that it
   fixes.
3. Open an issue first and seek advice for your change before
   submitting a pull request. Large features which have never been
   discussed are unlikely to be accepted.
